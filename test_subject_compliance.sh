# CC1 PROJECT - SUBJECT COMPLIANCE TEST
# ==========================================
# 
# 🎓 WHAT IS THIS SCRIPT?
# This is a comprehensive test that validates our C compiler implementation.
# Think of it as a "health check" that proves our compiler works correctly.
#
# 🏗️ WHAT WE'RE TESTING:
# We built a complete C compiler from scratch that takes C code and turns it 
# into executable programs. This script tests every piece of that pipeline.
#
# 📚 QUICK COMPILER LEXICON:
# • COMPILER: Program that translates code from one language to another
# • CC1: Our C compiler (converts C source → LLVM IR)  
# • FCC: Our compiler driver (orchestrates the full toolchain)
# • LLVM IR: Intermediate representation (like assembly but more portable)
# • LEXER: Breaks source code into tokens (like words in a sentence)
# • PARSER: Understands grammar and builds syntax trees
# • SEMANTICS: Checks that the code makes logical sense
# • ABI: Application Binary Interface (how functions call each other)
# • CROSS-COMPILATION: Building programs for different architectures
#
# 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:
# Every compiler you use (gcc, clang, etc.) goes through similar steps.
# We've implemented the complete pipeline that professional compilers use!
